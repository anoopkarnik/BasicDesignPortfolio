  There are two main categories of raw materials or icon making. The first category consists of
metals like copper, brass, lead, tin, zinc, silver and gold, which are used for casting, the second
category consists of materials like bees-wax (thennmezhuku), dammar (kunkulium) and
groundnut oil (kadala ennai) which are used for making wax models. The subsidiary raw
materials are charcoal, firewood cow dung cakes, tamarind, metal wires of different gauges
and clay of different varieties.
  <br>
  <br>
The quantities of metal were and other raw materials required for each icon depending on the
size of the icon. But there exists an exact proportion between the weight of the metals to be
used for casting a particular icon and the weight of the wax model used for the same icon.
The metal used for casting are purchased either in the form of solid pieces or in the form of
scraps. generally, the purchases are made either at Kumbakonam or at Tanjore. The prices of
solid metal and scrap metal don't differ much, but a good craftsman generally does not like to
use scrap metal as icons cast of scraps would not give good shine when polished.
Bees-wax is purchased at Kumbakonam market while dammer and groundnut oil are
purchased either at Kumbakonam or locally.
  <br><br>
Different varieties of clay required for making mould are collected from the bed of Kaveri river
following by the side of the village and also from the paddy fields. The artisans are not required
to pay anything for the clay, but they are to bear carrying
