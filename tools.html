  Almost all the sthapatis of swami- malai use the same kind of conventional tools. The modern
tools have not yet reached the individ- ual craftsman. The training cum production centre has,
however, procured a few modern tools, which also at times cater to the needs of the individual
craftsman. Of late, the craftsmen have begun to feel the necessity and usefulness of
modern appliances like electrically operated drillers, polishers etc. Most of the conventional
tools are prepared by the craftsmen themselves. A few tools, which are also used in other
crafts, are available in the market and are procured from there.

  <b>Odiolai</b> (measuring ribbon)
This tool is made for temporary use. It is made out of a small leaf of coconut leaf. The different proportions to be used in the image under preparation,
are marked o the ribbon by folding it.The total length of the ribbon is equal to the total length of the wax model, under preparation.
As and when one dries up it is replaced by another; otherwise, the ribbon would give wrong measures, as coconut leaf shrink is the process of drying.

  <b>Mezhuku Kathi</b> (knife used for cutting wax) Knives of varying sizes and shapes are used by the
craftsman for removing the unwanted portions. The knife most commonly used for this
purpose is called Mezhuku Kathi. The flat handle is wrapped with a cloth so that at the time of
operation the craftsman does not injure his fingers and has a good grip of the knife. The blade
is made out of thin and flex- ible steel.

  <b>Seevuli</b> (scraper)
Steel scrapers of different sizes, having dif- ferent types of working edges are used or scraping
the wax models so as to give them a sharper relief. They are also used or scrap- ping the
surface of the cast icons.
